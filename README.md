# react-quiz-creator
Working in progress...

I intend that with this project you can:
 - Create quizes very easily
 - Sort the questions and answers the way you want
 - Load/Save a JSON file of your quiz

## Stack
 - React
 - Babel
 - Webpack
 - Quill as RichText editor (React-quill)
 - React-beautiful-dnd to sort with drag and drop the elements
